This is a software for control the MEPIC45k50 development board based on the 
PIC microcontroller 45k50, for implement sequential logic and combinational 
logic without programming the board. It will usefull for people who wants to 
implement logic circuits before implement it.

## Features 

1. Moore logic circuits
2. Mealy logic circuits.
3. desktop app for the  MEPIC45K50 (custom platform from my university) based on 
the "pinguino" project of PIC.

## Resources

Some of the resources that I have used to create this project are:

* [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/)
* [Pyserial](https://pyserial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyserial.html)
* [PIC45k50](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/PIC18F45K50)

In future I want to create a version using arduino and change the desktop app
for an API.

for you.
