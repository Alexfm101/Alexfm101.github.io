During my internship, I worked on a project called SCADA solar system. It 
involved creating an interface in Mango automation that allows for monitoring of 
a solar system across multiple sites.

## Features 

1. Monitoring multiple sites.
2. Flow charts   
3. Solar PV monitoring: Power, Temperature, Solar Radiation, Status.
4. Battery monitoring: Power, SoC, Current, status.
5. Costumer monitoring: Voltage, Current, Power, Energy



## Resources

Some of the resources that I have used to create this project are:
