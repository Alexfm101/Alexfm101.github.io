During my internship, I worked on a project called SCADA solar system. It 
involved creating an interface in **Mango automation** that allows for 
monitoring of a solar system across multiple sites.

## Features 

- Monitoring multiple sites.
- Flow charts   
- Solar PV monitoring: Power, Temperature, Solar Radiation, Status.
- Battery monitoring: Power, SoC, Current, status.
- Costumer monitoring: Voltage, Current, Power, Energy

## Resources

Some of the resources that I have used to create this project are:
