I love space exploration, but I also want to continue improving my modeling 
skills in MuJoCo. One day, I saw on Twitter that the Ingenuity Mars helicopter 
completed its last flight on Mars. This is the first time a helicopter has 
flown on another planet, and I find it fascinating. That's why I thought, 
"why not create a MuJoCo version of it?" I found the official URDF models and 
assets of the Ingenuity and Perseverance rover. So, I created this MJCF version 
based on the original version, which you can see [here](https://github.com/nasa-jpl/m2020-urdf-models).

I would like to express my gratitude to the engineers at NASA JPL and Zareh 
Gorjian, who designed the textures and models for creating this project.

## Features

- IMU sensor
- Laser rangefinder sensor
- 1 navigation camera
- 2 actuators for each blade and 2 more XY movement
