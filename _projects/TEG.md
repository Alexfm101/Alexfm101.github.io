TEG is a set of Reinforcement Learning enviroments, Robot Models and tools for training AI agents. This project started as my Bachelor thesis in Electrical Engineer but I have the intention of continue it and add more features that I hope would be usefull for Developers and Researchers.

## Features 

1. Reinforcement Learning enviroments for a single AI agent.
2. Robot Models (Currently UR5 only).
3. Example experiments and notebooks that serve as a guide in the use of this tool.
4. Additional abstractions for create more easy experiments with your agents.

In the future I hope add more features like different Robot Models, reinforcement learning environments and tools that even can create your own reinforcement learning environments if you like.

## Resources

Some of the resources that I have used to create this project are:

* [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym)
* [Mujoco](https://mujoco.org/)
* [Mujoco py](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py) 
* [UR5](https://github.com/roboticsleeds/mujoco-ur5-model)



This project is in continuous development so you can find issues and bugs but If you wanna see more information about this project, you can visit my [*GitHub*](www.github.com/Alexfm101/TEG), I hope it would be usefull for you.
