TEG is a Reinforcement Learning enviroment, for training AI agents. 
This project started as my Bachelor thesis in Electrical Engineer but I have 
the intention of continue it and add more features that I hope would be usefull 
for Developers and Researchers.

## Features 

- Reinforcement Learning enviroment for a single AI agent.
- Robot Models (Currently UR5 only).

## Resources

Some of the resources that I have used to create this project are:

- [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym)
- [Mujoco](https://mujoco.org/)
- [Mujoco py](https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py) 
- [UR5](https://github.com/roboticsleeds/mujoco-ur5-model)

If you want to see more information about this project, you can visit my 
[*GitHub*](www.github.com/Alefram/TEG), I hope it would be usefull for you.
