Welcome to my blog! In this first post, I&apos;d like to share some of the resources 
that have helped me learn. I hope they can be helpful for you too. If you know 
of any other useful resources, feel free to send me a message on [X](https://x.com/_Alefram_) and 
I&apos;ll take a look and possibly add them to the list.

AI and robotics are enormous fields with many different areas to explore.
Personally, I tend to focus on...

- **Reinforcement Learning to continuous control.**
- **Simulation and control for Robotics systems.**
- **Computer Architecture trends for accelerate neural networks and Robotics.**

Yeah is a lot!!!.
