In my journey learning the basics of Robotics manipulation, I was wondering how
to do simple inverse kinematics. I know that there is a lot of libraries that
implement this stuff, but I want to practice on how to translate the math/pseudocode 
to the implementation specially in MuJoCo which is my principal simulator for 
implement my experiments right now. This what I learn.

## What is inverse kinematics?

Imagine that you have a robot of manipulator with 6 joints and one end-effector 
(the tool that the robot use like a pinza), you wanna to move the end-effector
to a specific point in a 3D space for some task. How do you know what are the 
specific coordinates that the joints required to pose the end-effector in your desire point?,
That's the question that inverse kinematics answer. Inverse kinematics is the mapping
of end-effector pose to joint coordinates.

Giving that there's two ways to solve inverse kinematics, the analytical 
approach and the numerical approach. The analytical approach, consist in use the
mathematical model...


In this article I will focus on the numerical approaches that I found.

## Inverse Kinematics algorithms

Searching for the most commun ways of compute the inverse kinematics, I found the
master thesis of Anton Larsson and Oskar GrÃ¶nlund called "Comparative Analysis of 
the Inverse Kinematics of a 6-DOF Manipulator". In this thesis they talked about
the way to describe the relation approximately between joint angles and desire 
position using the Jacobian, where they explain 3 methods: **Gradient Descent**, **Gauss-Newton**
and **Levenberg-Marquardt**.

Seeing that they provide the algorithm pseudocode of each, I have the idea of trying 
to re implement this tecniques in mujoco for practice so let me explain how I do it.


### Gauss-Newton 

The Gauss-Newton algorithm is a extension of a Newton's method for finding a 
minimum of a non-lineaf function. 

```latex
goal_pose = y
q = current joint angles
step_size = desired step size
tolerance = set tolerance
e = goal_pose - current_pose
while norm(e) >= tolerance do
    J = Jacobian(q)
    J_T = J.transpose()
    J_pinv = (J_T * J).inv() * J_T
    delta_q = J_pinv * e
    q += step_size * delta_q
    q = check_joint_limits(q)
    e = goal_pose - ForwardKinematics(q)
end while
```

### Gradient Descent

```latex
goal_pose = y
q = current joint angles
step_size = desired step size
tolerance = set tolerance
e = goal_pose - current_pose
while norm(e) >= tolerance do
    J = Jacobian(q)
    J_T = J.transpose()
    gradient = alpha * J_T * e
    q += step_size * gradient
    q = check_joint_limits(q)
    e = goal_pose - ForwardKinematics(q)
end while
```

### Levenberg-Marquardt 

```latex
goal_pose = y
q = current joint angles
step_size = desired step size
tolerance = set tolerance
e = goal_pose - current_pose
lambda = damping factor

while norm(e) >= tolerance do
    J = Jacobian(q)
    J_T = Jacobian.transpose()
    J_inv = (J_T * J + lambda * I).inv() * J_T
    delta_q = J_inv * e
    q += step_size * delta_q
    q = check_joint_limits(q)
    e = goal_pose - ForwardKinematics(q)
end while
```
