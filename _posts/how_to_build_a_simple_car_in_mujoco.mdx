Mujoco is one of the physics engine most use in robotics research, biomechanics and machine learning for train AI agents.
When I did my bachelor thesis in reinforcement learning, I learned how to create simple Mujoco models for create reinforcement
learning environments, I will show you how, so let's get started:

## Installation

First we need to install Mujoco, in this tutorial we are going to use the **Mujoco python binding** library which use Python3.7+.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="bash">
  {`python -m  pip install mujoco`}
</SyntaxHighlighter>
