When i start to study Reinforcement Learning few months ago, "gym" was the best library for start experimenting with the tecnique, right now i am using it in my Bachelor thesis for training an agent to control a robot arm (hard problem by the way), but, i was very curious of how to create an environment by my own. Here i will show you what i learn about to how to create a very simple reinforcement learning environment gridworld to train an agent to go from a point A to B from scratch using OpenAI gym so let gets start it.
