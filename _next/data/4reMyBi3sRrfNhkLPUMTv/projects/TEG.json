{"pageProps":{"projectData":{"id":"TEG","contentHtml":"<p>TEG is a set of Reinforcement Learning enviroments, Robot Models and tools for training AI agents. This project started as my Bachelor thesis in Electrical Engineer but I have the intention of continue it and add more features that I hope would be usefull for Developers and Researchers.</p>\n<h2>Features</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>Reinforcement Learning enviroments for a single AI agent.</li>\n<li>Robot Models (Currently UR5 only).</li>\n<li>Example experiments and notebooks that serve as a guide in the use of this tool.</li>\n<li>Additional abstractions for create more easy experiments with your agents.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In the future I hope add more features like different Robot Models, reinforcement learning environments and tools that even can create your own reinforcement learning environments if you like.</p>\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n<p>Some of the resources that I have used to create this project are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openai/gym\">OpenAI Gym</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://mujoco.org/\">Mujoco</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py\">Mujoco py</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/roboticsleeds/mujoco-ur5-model\">UR5</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This project is in continuous development so you can find issues and bugs but If you wanna see more information about this project, you can visit my <a href=\"www.github.com/Alefram/TEG\"><em>GitHub</em></a>, I hope it would be usefull for you.</p>","title":"TEG","description":"A set of tools for the develop of AI agents in robot manipulation","image":"images/projects/TEG.png","altImage":"TEG","keywords":"Machine Learning, Robotics, Electronics, Reinforcement Learning, Blog, Portfolio, Alexis, Fraudita, Alexis Fraudita, Python, Pytorch"}},"__N_SSG":true}
