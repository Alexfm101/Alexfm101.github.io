    title: 'Building a PID controller in Python from scratch',

When I was in the university, my control system classes was dictated using MATLAB,
MATLAB is a powerfull tool to design and test control systems. But, one of the
things that overwhelms me about Matlab, is that it is a very heavy program with 
different types of packages for different uses and a large number of tools and 
I like a simple minimalist coding style stuff for create or design controllers. 

As I am familiar with Python, I became curious to utilize this language to design 
a basic control system such as a PID controller, applying the theory I learned 
in university.

So here is what I learned.

## What is a PID controller?

A basic diagram of a PID controller looks like this:

![pid](/images/pid.drawio.svg)

e(t) is known as the error signal, which is the difference between a desired 
process value or setpoint r(t) and a measured process variable y(t) from the 
system that we want to control called "plant". u(t) is the output of the PID 
controller known as the control signal that will attempts to minimize the error 
e(t) over time. 

The PID controller, consists in 3 different parts: the Proportional part, 
the integral part and the derivative part.

The proportional part helps to maintain the desired output of the control 
system by working to reduce the difference between the desired output and the 
actual output of the system. For example, the cruise control that keeps you at 
the right speed when you're driving on a flat road. If you start going too slow, 
the proportional part tells the car to go a little faster so you get back to the 
right speed. If you start going too fast, it tells the car to go slower.

The integral part, keeps track of how much the system has been off from the 
desired output in the past and makes adjustments to help reduce that difference 
over time. It's like a person who remembers that they were too hot or too cold 
in a room yesterday and adjusts the thermostat today to make sure they're more 
comfortable.

The derivative part of a PID controller is like a watchdog that watches how 
things are changing over time. It looks for how fast things are changing and 
makes adjustments based on that. Imagine you're going downhill in your car and 
you start going faster, the derivative part of a cruise control system would 
sense this change in speed and make adjustments to slow you down.

Mathematly, in time domain the PID controller looks like this:

<div style={{ display: 'block', margin: 'auto', width: '60%' }}>
    <InlineMath math="u(t) = K_p e(t) + K_i \int_{0}^{t} e(\tau) d\tau + K_d \frac{d}{dt} e(t)"/>
</div>

Where:

* <InlineMath math="K_p"/>: represents how much the output of the controller 
changes in response to a difference between the desired output and the actual 
output of the system.

* <InlineMath math="k_i"/>: represents how much the output of the controller 
changes in response to the accumulated difference between the desired and actual
outputs of the system over time.

* <InlineMath math="k_d"/>: represents how much the output of the controller 
changes in response to the rate of change of the difference between the desired 
and actual outputs of the system.

* <InlineMath math="e(t)"/>: represents the error signal.

* <InlineMath math="u(t)"/>: represents control signal.

Next, we'll use python-control, sympy and scipy to design a PID controller and 
plot it using Matplotlib.

## Desiging the PID controller


### Creating the model system

First, we need a system to control before create our PID controller. We can do
this using the python-control package.

We can use this model system as example.

<div style={{display: 'block', margin: 'auto', width: '20%'}}>
    <InlineMath math="\frac{1}{s(s+1)(s+5)}"/>
</div>

You may be wondering why s?, it's because the Laplace domain. It is used instead
of time domain because it allows for analysis of the transfer functions of linear 
time-invariant systems(LTI) in a simpler and more efficient manner.

So we create our model transfer function system like this.

```python
import control

s = control.TransferFunction.s

system = 1/(s*(s+1)*(s+5))

```

### Creating the PID

Lets create our PID in Laplace domain.

<div style={{display: 'block', margin: 'auto', width: '40%'}}>
    <InlineMath math="G_{c}(s) = K_{p}(1 + \frac{1}{T_{i}s} + T_{d}s)"/>
</div>

Where:

* <InlineMath math="K_{p}"/>: represents how much the output of the controller 
changes in response to a difference between the desired output and the actual 
output of the system.

* <InlineMath math="T_{i}"/>: represents  the integral time.

* <InlineMath math="T_{d}"/>: represents the derivative time.

Now, our objective is to Tune the values of <InlineMath math="K_{p}"/>, 
<InlineMath math="T_{i}"/> and <InlineMath math="T_{d}"/>.
To find these values, we will use the Ziegler–Nichols tuning rule.

since the system plant have an integrator (<InlineMath manth="1/s"/>), we will
use the second method of Ziegler–Nichols which consist in setting <InlineMath math="T_{i}=\infty"/>
and <InlineMath math="T_{d}=0"/> to obtain the closed-loop transfer function.

Because we get the transfer function of the system plant using python-control, 
we can also use the feedback method to get the closed loop transfer function. 
We will add arbitrary value to <InlineMath math="K_{p}"/> to do the calculation,
0 to <InlineMath math="T_{d}"/> and a big number to <InlineMath math="T_{i}"/> 
to get the closed loop transfer function.

```python
import control

s = control.TransferFunction.s

system = 1/(s*(s+1)*(s+5))

Kp = 17
Ti = 10000000000
Td = 0
pid = Kp*(1 + 1/Ti*s + Td*s)

feedback = control.feedback(system*pid)
print(feedback)

#result
#    1.7e-08 s + 17
#----------------------
#s^3 + 6 s^2 + 5 s + 17
```

So we know that our closed loop transfer function will be like this:

<div style={{display: 'block', margin: 'auto', width: '40%'}}>
    <InlineMath math="\frac{G(s)}{R(s)} = \frac{K_{p}}{s^{3} + 6s^{2} + 5s + K_{p}}"/>
</div>

Where <InlineMath math="s^{3} + 6s^{2} + 5s + K_{p} = 0"/> will be our charateristic 
equation.
