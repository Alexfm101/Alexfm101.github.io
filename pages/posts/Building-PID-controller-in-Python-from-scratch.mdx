The PID controller is an essential tool used in multiple industries, enabling 
the maintenance of the desired setpoint and ensuring control and stability.By 
mastering the PID controller, you can optimize a range of projects and 
applications, achieving excellent control over your system. Building a PID 
controller from scratch in Python is not only a valuable skill but also a step 
towards taking full advantage of this powerful control mechanism.

{/* The PID controller, works by using a feedback loop to continuously adjust inputs 
and outputs, while the Proportional, Integral, and Derivative components 
calculate the necessary corrections. */}
